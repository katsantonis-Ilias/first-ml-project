# My First Machine Learning Project

This is a mini machine learning project to [Do countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have a lower cost of living relative to their income].

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle]
- Size: [10, 4]
- Features: [Country, GDP_per_capita, Cost_of_Living, Purchasing_Power]

## 🔍 What I Did
- Data exploration
- Cleaning & preprocessing
- Model training (Linear Regression)
- Evaluation (R²,Residual )
- Final Reflection - short conclusion

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- How to prepare data for ML
- How to train and evaluate a model

## 📁 Project Files
- `Does Higher GDP per Capita Reduce Cost of Living.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook
- `cost_of_living_data.csv` – Sample dataset
- `requirements.txt` – Libraries used

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Try different models
- Use cross-validation
- Deploy as a web app (future)
